To Enable Proxy-Addresses Active Directory Schema Attribute
===========================================================

RMS provides the proxy-addresses schema attribute for the discovery of additional e-mail addresses for a user account. This is useful if a user changes his or her e-mail address but still requires access to RMS-protected content that was licensed under a previous e-mail account.

By default the values in the proxy-addresses schema attribute are not replicated to the Global Catalog. You must either adjust the settings on the proxy-addresses schema attribute manually or install Microsoft Exchange Server.

> [!Important]  
> If you are using Microsoft Exchange Server, these steps are not required because Exchange Server enables this attribute during installation.

If you are not using Microsoft Exchange Server in your environment but would like to take advantage of the proxy-addresses schema attribute, you must enable and populate the proxy-addresses schema attribute manually.

This can be done by using the ADSI Edit tool. ADSI Edit is available with Windows Server 2003 Support Tools and allows an Active Directory administrator to modify all Active Directory schema attributes from a central console.

> [!Note]  
> The following procedures assume that a user account named User1 is in a domain named cpandl.com. You should substitute these names for your environment. 

First, follow these steps to install ADSI Edit:

**To install Windows Server 2003 Support Tools**
1.  Log on to a domain controller with an account that has rights to modify the Active Directory schema.

2.  Insert the Windows Server 2003 product CD and navigate to Support\\Tools.

    > [!Caution]  
	> In a production environment, the Windows Server 2003 Support Tools should be installed on a client computer that is joined to the domain. 

3.  Double-click suptools.msi to start the installation.

4.  On the Welcome screen, click **Next**.

5.  Click the **I Agree** option to accept the End User License Agreement, and then click **Next**.

6.  Type your name in the **Name** box and your organization's name in the **Organization** box, and then click **Next**.

7.  Click **Install Now**.

8.  When the installation has completed, click **Finish**.

Next, enable the proxy-addresses schema attribute:
