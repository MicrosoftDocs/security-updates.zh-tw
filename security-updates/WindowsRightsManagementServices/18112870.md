To Install RMS with Service Pack 2
==================================

To perform this procedure, you must be logged on locally to the administration Web site with a domain user account that is a member of the Administrators group. Members of the Domain Admins group can also perform this procedure. As a security best practice, consider using **Run as** to perform this procedure.

The computer on which you are installing RMS must be a member server in a domain, or it must be a domain controller. You cannot deploy RMS on a stand-alone server in a workgroup.

> [!Important]  
> Do not provision RMS on any other servers until you have completed both the installation and provisioning of the first server in the root cluster.

> [!Important]  
> If you are upgrading from a previous version of RMS, you must install RMS with Service Pack 1 (SP1) before installing RMS with Service Pack 2 (SP2).
