Do not provision RMS on a server until you have a database installed to support the RMS configuration database.

It is recommended that Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition be used to support RMS databases only in test environments because Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition does not include the tools necessary to fully operate and support an enterprise wide database. Additionally, because Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition does not support remote networking, you must install it on the same server as RMS and you cannot add additional RMS servers to the RMS cluster.

The default installation of Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition does not include a way to manipulate or view the data that is stored in the RMS databases. In order to use this functionality, you must download SQL Server Management Studio Express available from the Microsoft Web site.
