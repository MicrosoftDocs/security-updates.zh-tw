Chain WSUS Servers Together
===========================

There is a discussion of the benefits and limitations of this process in "Chain of WSUS Servers," in [Choose a Type of Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/bc61fb16-13d4-4b3e-b547-fae6a0d5b7bc) earlier in this guide.

**To connect a downstream server to an upstream server**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  In the **Update Source** box, click **Synchronize from an upstream Windows Server Update Services server**, and then enter the server name and port number in the corresponding boxes.

3.  Under **Tasks**, click **Save settings**, and then click **OK** when the confirmation box appears.
