Windows Server Update Services communities
------------------------------------------

Microsoft communities are great places to exchange ideas with other users and discuss common issues. You can read and write messages by using an NNTP-based newsreader such as Microsoft Outlook Express. You can also use the Web-based newsreader provided by Microsoft to access all of the newsgroups. To access the WSUS Communities, see the [Windows Server Update Services Communities Homepage](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=45215) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=45215).
