Issues with Update Installation on Clients
==========================================

If WSUS clients are not installing updates, there may be issues with DCOM configuration. You will see event ID 10311 or 10312 in the application log if this is the case.

Troubleshooting Update Installation Issues
------------------------------------------

#### Checking DCOM Configuration

The process of checking DCOM configuration is slightly different on different operating systems.

**To check DCOM configuration on Windows Vista and WindowsÂ XP**
1.  Open a Command Prompt window.

2.  Type the following command: **dcomcnfg**
    (The **Component Services** window will appear.)

3.  Right-click **My Computer**, click **Properties**.

4.  Click the **Default Properties** tab.

5.  Make sure that **EnableDistributed COM on this computer** is selected.

6.  Make sure that **Default Impersonation Level** is set to **Identify**.

7.  Click **OK**, and then close the **Component Services** window.

#### Default DCOM Permissions

Default DCOM permissions can also be a source of problems.

**To remove default DCOM permissions**
1.  Open the **Registry Editor**.

2.  Navigate to HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Ole.

3.  If there is a **DefaultAccessPermission** key, delete it.
