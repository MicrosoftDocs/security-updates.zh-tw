Select Products and Classifications
===================================

After you specify the proxy server, you are ready to select the products you want to update and the types of updates you want to download. There is a description of why you might want to do this in "Filtering Updates," in [Determine Bandwidth Options to Use for Your Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/8001cd1d-8c32-4962-8bad-9dede4cd90e5) earlier in this guide.

**To specify update products and classifications for synchronization**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  In the **Products and Classifications** box, under **Products**, click **Change**.

3.  In the **Add/Remove Products** box, under **Products**, select the products or product families for the updates you want your WSUS server to download, and then click **OK**.

4.  Under **Update classifications**, click **Change**.

5.  In the **Add/Remove Classifications** box, under **Classifications**, select the update classifications for the updates you want your WSUS server to download, and then click **OK**.

| You may have to do an initial synchronization to get some products to appear in the list of product classifications. |
