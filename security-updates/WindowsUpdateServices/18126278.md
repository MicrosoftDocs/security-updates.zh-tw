Install the WSUS Server
=======================

After designing the WSUS deployment, you are ready to install the WSUS server component. Use the five topics listed below to prepare the computer and the network environment for WSUS. Check hardware and software requirements, including database software. If you want to create a custom Web site or install WSUS to a computer that already has a Web site, see the IIS section. If you have a firewall or proxy server, see the firewall section to ensure that WSUS has access to updates on the Internet. After you have done all that, then install and configure the WSUS server.

If you are doing a migration from Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS) or installing WSUS on a computer with SUS, see [Migrate from a SUS Server to a WSUS Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/5017f775-c9b1-4b33-879f-a14056c6a01c).
