Step 6: Decommission SUS and Move WSUS to Port 80
=================================================

Prior to decommissioning SUS you may want to test the WSUS server with a client computer. To point client computers to the WSUS server on the custom port, include a custom port number in the URL directing the client computer to the WSUS server—for example, https://WSUSServerName:8530.

Once you have tested WSUS in your environment, you are ready to decommission the SUS server and then change the WSUS Web site from the custom port (8530) to port 80. Remember to point any client computers being used to test WSUS back to the URL without the custom port numbers.

As the SUS clients check in with the WSUS server, they will begin to appear in the WSUS console. Note that you do not need to make any changes to Group Policy to get the SUS clients to appear in the WSUS console.

If you prefer to leave your updating solution on a port other than port 80, you can leave WSUS on the custom 8530 port and change the client policy to point to this port on your WSUS server. You still need to leave the virtual selfupdate directory on port 80 to allow client computers that are not WSUS-compatible to get updated to the WSUS-compatible client.

**To decommission SUS**
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Open** box, type **inetmgr** and then click **OK**.

3.  In IIS, right-click the SUS Web site, and then click **Stop**.

**To switch WSUS to port 80**
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Open** box, type **inetmgr** and then click **OK**.

3.  In IIS, right-click the WSUS Web site, and then click **Properties**.

4.  In the **WSUS Administration Properties** dialog box, change the value in **TCP port** from **8530** to **80**.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you change the port number after installing WSUS, you have to create a new shortcut on your **Start** menu with the new URL to access the WSUS console from the **Start** menu. See Help and Support for instruction on creating shortcuts.
