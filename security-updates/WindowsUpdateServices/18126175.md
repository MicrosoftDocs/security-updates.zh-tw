Appendix B: Uninstalling WSUS 3.0 from SQL Server
=================================================

Read the following information before uninstalling WSUS.

Uninstalling WSUS might leave some WSUS accounts on computers running SQL Server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Local SQL Server accounts that are created by WSUS Setup are not removed by the WSUS uninstall component. The WSUS uninstall component does not remove the Network Service and ASP.NET accounts from the local computer running SQL Server. If some other application or database is using these accounts, this ensures that these applications or databases do not fail. If you are sure that no other application or database requires the Network Service or ASP.NET accounts, you can manually remove them from the computer running SQL Server.

For information about how to manually remove Network Service or ASP.NET accounts from a computer running SQL ServerÂ 2005 or Windows Internal Database, see SQL Server product documentation. You can download product documentation for SQL Server at [SQL Server Books Online](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=81092) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=81092).
