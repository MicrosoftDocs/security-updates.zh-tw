Updating Windows Vista Beta 2 Computers
=======================================

Windows Server Update Services Service Pack 1 (WSUS SP1) supports updates for computers running Windows Vista Beta 2. These updates will be available only from [Microsoft Update Beta](http://beta.update.microsoft.com/).

Earlier versions of WSUS do not provide updates for Windows Vista Beta 2.

WSUS SP1 Server Configuration
-----------------------------

Do the procedure in this section to configure a WSUS SP1 server to retrieve updates from a Microsoft Update Beta server, which hosts all available updates including Windows Vista Beta 2.

Microsoft recommends that you dedicate a WSUS SP1 server exclusively for the purpose of updating Windows Vista Beta 2 clients and you do not use this dedicated WSUS SP1 server for updating production clients such as Windows XP.

Microsoft also recommends that you complete a fresh installation of WSUS SP1 in a beta environment to service your Windows Vista Beta 2 clients. Microsoft provides a tool that enables you to change the default update source to point to the Microsoft Update Beta site to get updates for your Windows Vista Beta 2 computers.

**To configure a WSUS SP1 server to get updates from Microsoft Update Beta**
-   On your WSUS SP1 server, at the command line, type:

    **cscript.exe "%programfiles%\\update services\\tools\\ToggleMUUrl.vbs" beta**

Restoring the previous update source back to Microsoft Update
-------------------------------------------------------------

At the conclusion of Windows Vista Beta 2, you may want to return your dedicated WSUS SP1 server to a production update server mapped to Microsoft Update. To return the WSUS SP1 server to production status mapped to Microsoft Update:

1.  Uninstall WSUS SP1 from your server
2.  On the remove Microsoft Windows Server Update Services dialog box:
    -   Select the box to remove the database.
    -   Select the box to remove the logfiles.
    -   Leave the box unchecked or do not remove the downloaded update files. This will ensure you do not have to download content that was previously downloaded.
