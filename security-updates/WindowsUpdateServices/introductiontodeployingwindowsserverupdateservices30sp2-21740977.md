Introduction to Deploying Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2
================================================================

This guide describes how to deploy Microsoft® Windows® Server Update Services (WSUS) 3.0 SP2. Begin your WSUS deployment by reading about how WSUS functions, its general requirements, and its features for scalability and bandwidth management. Read how to choose a network and database configuration for your WSUS 3.0 SP2 installation in [Design the WSUS 3.0 SP2 Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/31b20259-1b32-4316-959e-84b478705cc6). Next, read how to install and configure the WSUS server in the section [Install the WSUS 3.0 SP2 Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/2cd2d2ac-47e8-461f-99bd-db6bd3af1dfc). Then read how to configure Automatic Updates on client workstations and servers that will be updated by WSUS in [Update and Configure the Automatic Updates Client](https://technet.microsoft.com/d3d56210-9f71-49b7-b0d1-a04fb52d4e53).
