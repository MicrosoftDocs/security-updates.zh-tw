Install the WSUS 3.0 Administration Console
===========================================

After installing WSUS 3.0 on a server, you can manage WSUS 3.0 from any computer on your network, as long as the domain of that computer has a trust relationship with the domain of the server. You will need to perform a separate installation, from the same downloaded installation package, on every machine from which you want to run the WSUS 3.0 administration console.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The WSUS 3.0 administration console can be used to manage any WSUS server that has a trust relationship with the administration console computer.
