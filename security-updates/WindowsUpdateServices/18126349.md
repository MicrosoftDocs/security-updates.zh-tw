WSUS 3.0 and the Catalog Site
=============================

The catalog site is the Microsoft location from which you can import hotfixes and hardware drivers.

Importing hotfixes from the Microsoft Update catalog site
---------------------------------------------------------

In order to import hotfixes into WSUS, you must access the Microsoft Update catalog site from a WSUS computer.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Any computer that has the WSUS administrative console installed, whether or not it is a WSUS server, can be used to import hotfixes from the catalog site. You must be logged on to the computer as an administrator to import the hotfixes. |

**To access the Microsoft Update catalog site**
1.  In the WSUS administrative console, select either the top server node or the **Updates** node, and in the **Actions** pane click **Import Updates**.

2.  A browser window will open at the Microsoft Update Catalog Web site.

3.  In order to access the updates at this site, you must install the Microsoft Update Catalog ActiveX control.

4.  You can browse this site for Windows hotfixes and hardware drivers. When you have found the ones you want, add them to your basket.

5.  When you have finished browsing, go to the basket and click **Import** to import your updates. To download the updates without importing them, clear the **Import directly into Windows Server Update Services** checkbox.

Restricting access to hotfixes
------------------------------

WSUS administrators should use the following steps to restrict access to the hotfixes they have downloaded from the Microsoft Update catalog site.

**To restrict access to hotfixes**
1.  Enable Windows authentication on the IIS Content vroot.

    -   Start **IIS Manager** (click **Start**, then **Administrative Tools**, and then **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**).
    -   Navigate to the Content node of the WSUS Web site.
    -   Click **Properties** and open the **Directory Security** tab.
    -   Under **Authentication and access control**, click **Edit**.
    -   In the **Authentication Methods** screen, clear the **Enable anonymous access** checkbox and select the **Integrated Windows authentication** check box.

2.  Create a WSUS target group for the computers that need the hotfix, and add them to the group. For more information about computers and groups, see [Managing the Client Computers and Computer Groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/b812f314-79df-408b-b3ca-2b4a5d00aa2b).

3.  Download the files for the hotfix.

4.  Set the permissions of these files so that only machine accounts of those machines can read them. You will also need to allow the Network Service account full access to the files

5.  Approve the hotfix for the WSUS target group created in Step 2.

#### Importing updates in different languages

The Microsoft Update Catalog Web site includes updates that support multiple languages. It is very important to match the languages supported by the WSUS server with the languages supported by these updates. If the WSUS server does not support all the languages included in the update, the update will not be deployed to client computers. Likewise, if an update supporting multiple languages has been downloaded to the WSUS server but not yet deployed to client computers, and an administrator deselects one of the languages included the update, the update will not be deployed to the clients.
