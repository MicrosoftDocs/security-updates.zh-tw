Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started with Microsoft Windows Server Update Services 2.0 on Windows 2000 Server
==============================================================================================================

Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) provides a comprehensive solution for managing updates within your network. This document offers step-by-step instructions for basic tasks involved with deploying WSUS on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server operating systems. Use this guide to perform the following tasks:

-   Install WSUS to Windows 2000 Server operating systems.
-   Configure WSUS to obtain updates from Microsoft.
-   Configure client computers to install updates from WSUS.
-   Approve, test, and distribute updates.

Although WSUS is a feature-rich update-management solution, this guide offers only a single way to accomplish any of these tasks on Windows 2000 Server. When there are options to perform a task in different ways, a note calls out these choices and points to more comprehensive instructions in the “Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services” white paper or the “Microsoft Windows Server Update Services Operations Guide” white paper.

In addition, there is a version of this guide written specifically for Windows Server 2003, which uses slightly different procedures than the ones described here. See “Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started with Microsoft Windows Server Update Services.” The latest versions of these documents are available at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171>.
