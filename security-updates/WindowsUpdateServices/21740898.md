Appendix G: Detect the Version of WSUS
======================================

The way you detect the version of a WSUS installation has changed in WSUS 3.0 SP2. In previous versions, WSUS used Microsoft© Windows© Installer product keys. In WSUS 3.0 SP2, versioning is persisted in the registry to support new installer technologies such as CBS for Windows Vista® and Windows Server® 2008.

Versioning in WSUS 2.0
----------------------

Check for the install state of the following Windows Installer product key:

```
{A0D46DC6-8950-451A-8990-53C86E17666E}
```

In WSUS 2.0, the WSUS registry key:

**HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Update Services\\Server\\Setup**

has an InstallType subkey with the following possible values:

**Frontend = 32**

**Backend = 64**

**FullInstall = 128**

 

> [!NOTE]  
> You can upgrade from WSUS 2.0 to WSUS 3.0 SP2 for installations with the <strong>Frontend</strong> and <strong>FullInstall</strong> values. For the <strong>Backend</strong> value, you would uninstall WSUS, leaving the database behind. This database will be upgraded when the front-end WSUS server that points to the database is upgraded.
 

WSUS 3.0 SP2 pre-release candidate versions
-------------------------------------------

Versions of WSUS 3.0 SP2 that precede the first release candidate version also have Windows Installer product keys. There is one product key for 32-bit architectures and another for 64-bit architectures.

`{BCE8923B-20C9-4EBD-AB18-31CDC13B92E6}` (x86)

`{2E3FC5F0-0415-4e75-A3D3-74077F809FDD}` (x64)

WSUS 3.0 SP2 Release Candidate 1 and later versions
---------------------------------------------------

For WSUS 3.0 SP2, there is no Windows Installer product key, but there are two registry values: **InstallType** supports only two installation types: 1 = install or 2 = console-only install. **VersionString** is a string of the form **Major.Minor.Build.Revision**.

**To detect WSUS versions**
1.  Check that SUS 1.0 and WSUS 2.0 are not installed (by looking for the product keys).

2.  Find the registry key HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Update Services\\Server\\Setup.

3.  Check the **InstallType** values (32/64/128 if WSUS 2.0, 1/2 if WSUS 3.0).

4.  Check for **VersionString** values.
