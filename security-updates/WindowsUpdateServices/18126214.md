Configure Advanced Synchronization Options
==========================================

Advanced synchronization features include various options to manage bandwidth and store updates. There is a description of each of these features, including reasons why these features are useful, and their limitations, in [Determine Where to Store Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/3102c059-d7a4-49d8-8de8-299e730bb109) and [Determine Bandwidth Options to Use for Your Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/8001cd1d-8c32-4962-8bad-9dede4cd90e5) earlier in this guide.

Update Storage Options
----------------------

Use the **Update Files** section to determine if updates will be stored on WSUS or if client computers will connect to the Internet to get updates. There is a description of this feature in [Determine Where to Store Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/3102c059-d7a4-49d8-8de8-299e730bb109) earlier in this guide.

**To specify where updates are stored**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Update Files and Languages**, click **Advanced**, then read the warning and click **OK**.

3.  If you want to store updates in WSUS, in the **Advanced Synchronization Options** dialog box, under **Update Files**, click **Store update files locally on this server**. If you want clients to connect to the Internet to get updates, then click **Do not store updates locally; clients install updates from Microsoft Update.**

Deferred Downloads Options
--------------------------

Use the **Update Files** section to determine if updates should be downloaded during synchronization or when the update is approved. Find a description of this feature in "Deferring the Download of Updates," in [Determine Bandwidth Options to Use for Your Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/8001cd1d-8c32-4962-8bad-9dede4cd90e5) earlier in this guide.

**To specify whether updates are downloaded during synchronization or when the update is approved**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Update Files and Languages**, click **Advanced**, then read the warning and click **OK**.

3.  If you want to download only metadata about the updates during synchronization, in the **Advanced Synchronization Options** dialog box, under **Update Files**, select the **Download updates to this server only when updates are approved** check box. If you want the update files and metadata during synchronization, clear the check box.

Express Installation Files Options
----------------------------------

Use the **Update Files** section to determine if express installation files should be downloaded during synchronization. Find a description of this feature in “Using Express installation files,” in [Determine Bandwidth Options to Use for Your Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/8001cd1d-8c32-4962-8bad-9dede4cd90e5) earlier in this paper.

**To specify whether express installation files are downloaded during synchronization**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Update Files and Languages**, click **Advanced**, then read the warning and click **OK**.

3.  If you want to download express installation files, in the **Advanced Synchronization Options** dialog box, under **Update Files**, select the **Download express installation files** check box. If you do not want express installation files, clear the check box.

Filtering Updates Options
-------------------------

Use the **Languages** section to select the language of the updates to synchronize. There is a description of this feature in “Filtering updates,” in [Determine Bandwidth Options to Use for Your Deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/8001cd1d-8c32-4962-8bad-9dede4cd90e5) earlier in this guide.

**To specify language options**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Update Files and Languages**, click **Advanced**, then read the warning and click **OK**.

3.  In the **Advanced Synchronization Options** dialog box, under **Languages**, select one of the following language options, and then click **OK**.

    -   **Download only those updates that match the locale of this server (Locale)** where Locale is the name of the server locale. This means that only updates targeted to the locale of the server will be downloaded during synchronization.
    -   **Download updates in all languages, including new languages** This means that all languages will be downloaded during synchronization. If a new language is added, it will be automatically downloaded.
    -   **Download updates only in the selected languages** This means that only updates targeted to the languages you select will be downloaded during synchronization. If you choose this option, you must also choose each language you want from the list of those available.

| If you change language options, Microsoft recommends that you manually synchronize them between the centrally managed WSUS server and its replica servers. This avoids a situation where changing language options on the centrally managed server alone might result in the number of updates that are approved on it not matching the number approved on the replica servers. |
