Backing Up Windows Server Update Services
=========================================

Although WSUS does not provide a built-in backup tool, you can use the Backup Utility that is available on all servers running Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003 to easily back up and restore both the WSUS database and update file storage folder. The Backup Utility is also known as Ntbackup.exe.

Backing up WSUS involves backing up the following:

-   The WSUS database, which contains:
    -   Update metadata, including information about updates (for example, properties). Metadata is also where EULAs are stored.
    -   WSUS server configuration information, which includes all settings for your WSUS server (that is, options you specified through the WSUS console and settings configured by WSUS automatically during setup).
    -   Information about client computers, updates, and client interaction with updates. You can access this information through the WSUS console when you view status and run reports on update status and client computer status.
-   The folder where the update files are stored. Update files are the actual files required to install an update on a computer. By default, update files are stored in the *%systemdrive%*\\WSUS\\WSUSContent folder on your WSUS server. If you have chosen to store update files on Microsoft Update (either during setup or on the **Options** page), you do not have to back up the update file storage folder on your WSUS server.

If you are using a full version of Microsoft SQL Server 2000 for your database, which is not installed by WSUS, you can use SQL Server Enterprise manager as an alternative to the Backup Utility. For more information about SQL Server Enterprise Manager, refer to your SQL Server documentation. For more information about database options and configurations for WSUS, see [Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41777).

**To back up the update file storage folder**
1.  On your WSUS server, click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Open** box, type *%systemdrive%*\\*%windir%*\\**system32**\\**ntbackup.exe** and then click **OK**.

3.  In the Backup or Restore Wizard, click **Next**.

4.  Verify that **Back up files and settings** is selected, and then click **Next**.

5.  Click **Let me choose what to back up**, and then click **Next**.

6.  Select the WSUSContent folder (under *%systemdrive%*\\WSUS\\), and then click **Next**.

7.  Use the **Browse** button to choose a place to save your backup, type a name for the backup, and then click **Next**.

8.  If you want to set additional specifications for your backup, including whether it will be an incremental backup, whether you want to verify the backup, set a recurring schedule for the backup, or other options, click **Advanced**, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

9.  When the wizard is finished, click **Finish**.

10. When the message appears that informs you that the backup is complete, click **Close**.

    Alternatively, you can select a subset of the *%systemdrive%*\\WSUS\\WSUSContent folder to restore. Within the *%systemdrive%*\\WSUS\\WSUSContent folder, you can restore one, all, or a combination of its subfolders and files.

6.  If you want to set additional specifications for your restore, including whether you want to restore the files or folders to a different location, replace existing files, restore security settings, or specify other options, click **Advanced**, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

7.  When the wizard is finished, click **Finish**.

8.  When the message appears that informs you that restoring is complete, click **Close**.

**To restore the WSUS database**
1.  On your WSUS server, click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

Within the *%systemdrive%*\\WSUS\\MSQL$WSUS\\Data and *%systemdrive%*\\WSUS\\MSQL$WSUS\\LOG folders, you can restore one, all, or a combination of their subfolders and files.

6.  If you want to set additional specifications for your restore, including whether you want to restore the files or folders to a different location, replace existing files, restore security settings, or specify other options, click **Advanced**, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

7.  When the wizard is finished, click **Finish**.

8.  When the message appears that informs you that restoring is complete, click **Close**.

    After restoring the WSUS database you will recycle the WSUS Application Pool in IIS, as described in the remaining steps. This will ensure that the restored database will sync up correctly with IIS, through which you can manage the Web site where WSUS is installed. For more information about application pools, see IIS Help. For more information about how WSUS is installed, refer to [Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41777).

9.  Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

10. In the tree, expand **\[WSUSServerName\]**, and then expand **Application Pools**.

11. Right-click **WSUSpool**, and then click **Recycle**.

12. Close IIS Manager.
