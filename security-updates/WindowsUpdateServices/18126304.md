Step 4: Synchronize Your Server
===============================

After you configure the network connection, you must synchronize the server. When you synchronize, the server contacts Microsoft Update and determines whether any new updates have been made available since the last time you synchronized. Because this is the first time you are synchronizing, all available updates appear for you to approve for installation.

> [!NOTE]   
> This paper describes synchronization using some bandwidth optimizations during synchronization. For more information about further optimizing bandwidth, see “Deploying Microsoft Server Windows Update Services” at the [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171). 

Consider changing the default language options for updates. By default, WSUS is configured to download all languages. You can change this to download updates only for the languages available on your network.

**To change language options**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Update Files and Languages**, click **Advanced**.

3.  Select **Download updates only in the selected languages**, and then select only the languages of the computers available on your network.

**To synchronize your server with Microsoft Update**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Tasks**, click **Synchronize now**.

> [!NOTE]   
> The time required for synchronization depends on a number of things, including Internet connection speed and the number of products and update classifications selected. 

**To automate future synchronizations**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under Schedule, click **Synchronize daily at,** and then select a time for daily synchronizations from the drop down list.

By default, WSUS offers Critical and Security Updates for all Windows products to add products like SQL Server, Exchange, or Office, you must first synchronize WSUS and then perform the following procedure.

**To modify the default list of products to update**
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Options**, and then click **Synchronization Options**.

2.  Under **Products**, click **Change.**

3.  Select **Windows Small Business Server**. Additionally, to update all components that are integrated with Windows SBS, you must select those specific products. For example, select Exchange Server 2003, SQL Server™, and Office 2003 (to update the Outlook component).

> [!NOTE]   
> If you add products like SQL Server, Exchange, or Office, you must synchronize the server at least one time.
