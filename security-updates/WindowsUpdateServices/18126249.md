Issues with E-Mail Notifications
================================

If you are not receiving e-mail notifications after having set up your WSUS server to send them, you should check both the WSUS server's e-mail setup and the SMTP configuration on the e-mail server.

Troubleshooting the WSUS e-mail setup
-------------------------------------

In the WSUS administration console, click **Options**, and then click **E-Mail Notifications**. On the **E-Mail Server** tab, check the SMTP server name and port, the sender name and address, and the SMTP server authentication, if necessary. You can use the **Test** button to verify your settings.

Troubleshooting the SMTP server
-------------------------------

You can refer to articles such as [SMTP: Troubleshooting the TCP/IP Layer of the Mail Gateway](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=81082) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=81082) for more information about troubleshooting issues with the SMTP server.
