#### Status of Updates Report
  
The Status of Updates report enables you to view the status for all of your approved updates. You can view the report in three ways: you can view the status of an update at a high level, by computer group, and by computer.
  
The report displays information resulting from the most recent contact between client computers and the WSUS server. The frequency with which client computers contact the WSUS server is configured through Group Policy. By default, this is every 22 hours. Unless you want to change the contact frequency for your client computers, generate this report the day after you approve updates, so that it reflects your latest approvals. For more information about configuring Group Policy, see [Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Updates Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41777).
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can use a command-line tool on client computers that are running the WSUS client software (Automatic Updates) in order to initiate contact between the client computer and WSUS server. This can be useful if you want to get immediate update status for a particular computerâ€”you can run this tool to force connection and then generate a Status of Updates report.
  
**To initiate immediate contact between a client computer and WSUS server**  
-   On the client computer, at the command prompt, type **wuauclt.exe /detectnow**, and then press **ENTER**.
  
**To run a Status of Updates report**  
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Reports**.
  
2.  On the **Reports** page, click **Status of Updates**.
  
#### Update summary view
  
The update summary view is the default view that appears when you run a Status of Updates report. By default, the report displays an alphabetical list of approved updates.
  
You can filter the display by both approval action and computer group by making appropriate selections under **View** and then clicking **Apply**. Your filter is reset to the default list of all updates when you close the Status of Updates report.
  
The columns displayed in the update summary view are described in the following table.

You can also print the report, including the list of individual updates with status for individual computers, if you have expanded the computers (clicked the + symbol). However, you cannot print the dialog box that appears when you click individual updates in the list or when you click the status for an individual update.
  
**To run a status report for computers**  
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Reports**, and then click **Status of Computers**.
  
2.  Under **View**, select the criteria you want to use to filter the report, and then click **Apply**. The report displays a cumulative update status summary for all of the computers in the computer group and for the status you specified.
  
3.  If you want more information about a specific computer, you can do the following:
  
    -   To view the status of individual updates for the computer, expand the computer (click the + sign next to the computer). In addition, you can see the properties of an individual update by clicking the title of the update.  
    -   To view more information about the specific status result of an update (or, the event details), click the status for the update.
  
4.  To print the report, under **Tasks**, click **Print report**.
  
#### Synchronization Results Report
  
The Synchronization Results report enables you to see synchronization information for your server for a given time period, including errors that occurred during synchronization and a list of new updates. In addition, you can get general, status, and revision information for each new update.
  
**To run a Synchronization Results report**

4.  To print the report, under **Tasks**, click **Print report**.
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The **Print report** task is not enabled if you have a dialog box open. You cannot use the **Print report** task to print a dialog box.
  
The report has four components, which are described in the following table.

You can view or print two types of compliance status reports, one for individual computers and one for individual updates:
  
-   The computer compliance status report summarizes information for a specific computer, including basic software and hardware information, the success status of the computer's last contact with the WSUS server, and cumulative and individual update status for the computer. In addition, you can get more information about a specific update by clicking the update title.  
-   The update compliance status report summarizes information for a specific update, including the update properties, and status for each computer group. You can run this report from the **Updates** page as described in the following procedure; however, this report is also available on every update property dialog box.
  
**To run a computer compliance status report**  
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Computers**, and then click the computer for which you want to produce the compliance status report.
  
2.  Click **Print status report**.
  
3.  If you want more information about a specific update under **Update Status**, you can do the following:
  
    -   To view the properties of an individual update, click the title of the update.  
    -   To view more information about the specific status result of an update (or the event details), click the status for the update.
  
4.  To print the report, click the **File** menu, and then click **Print**.
  
**To run an update compliance status report**  
1.  On the WSUS console toolbar, click **Updates**, and then click the update for which you want to produce the compliance report.
  
2.  Click **Print status report**.
  
3.  To print the report, click the **File** menu, and then click **Print**.
