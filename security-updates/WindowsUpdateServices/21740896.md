Run WSUS 3.0 SP2 Server Setup
=============================

This section describes installing WSUS by using the installer file or Server Manager.

If you want to do an unattended installation, see [Appendix A: Unattended Installations](https://technet.microsoft.com/2443408e-5bd2-4b1f-b0a5-7ee1452fe5bc) later in this guide.

 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> As a best practice, review the Release Notes for WSUS 3.0 SP2. Release notes contain important information about the release. Look for the WSUS Release Notes on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=139840">Windows Server Update Services</a> Web site (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=139840). 

Before you begin
----------------

Before you start WSUS Setup, make sure that the root of the drive where WSUS stores updates has the required permissions. WSUS Setup does not modify permissions on the root drive where you store updates, but this drive may not have appropriate permissions set. For example, security tools may have been used to strip away default permissions from the disk before the installation of WSUS. To manage this problem, use the following procedure to check the drive and directories where updates are stored to ensure permissions are set correctly.

**To check permissions on the drive and directories where updates are stored**
1.  Double-click **My Computer**, right-click the drive where updates are stored, and then click **Sharing and Security**.

2.  Ensure that the drive has read permissions for the built-in Users group or **NT Authority\\Network Service**.

3.  Ensure that the root folder on the drive also has read permissions for **NT Authority\\Network Service**.

4.  Ensure that the content directory itself (usually &lt;*drivename*&gt;:\\WSUS\\WsusContent) has read permissions for **NT Authority\\Network Service**. These permissions should have been set by the installation program.

The default Web site needs to allow anonymous access (that is, read access) by the IUSER\_*servername* account. Some applications, notably Windows SharePoint Services, will remove anonymous access.

**To check for anonymous access to the default Web site**
1.  Go to the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager, click the server name, click **Web Sites**, and then right-click the WSUS Web site.

2.  In the context menu select **Permissions**.

3.  In the Security tab you should see the **Internet Guest Account** listing.

4.  If you do not see this account, you will need to add it.

5.  Add a user account named IUSR*\_serverName* to the local machine, where *serverName* is the name of the server.

6.  Give this account the following permissions: Read & Execute, List Folder Contents, and Read. You should deny write access to this account.

7.  Return to IIS Manager, right-click the WSUS Web site, and then click **Permissions**.

8.  Add the newly-created user to this Web site.

For more information about allowing anonymous access to Web sites, see [Allowing Anonymous Access to Web Sites (IIS 6.0)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=75850) at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=75850.

Installing WSUS
---------------

After ensuring that the server meets the minimum system requirements and that the necessary account permissions were granted, you are ready to install WSUS 3.0 SP2. Start the installation of WSUS 3.0 SP2 by using the applicable procedure for your operating system and kind of installation (by using either Server Manager or the WSUSSetup.exe file).

### If You Are Using Server Manager

**To start the installation of WSUS 3.0 SP2 Server by using Server Manager**
1.  Log on to the server on which you plan to install WSUS 3.0 SP2 by using an account that is a member of the local Administrators group.

2.  Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Server Manager**.

3.  In the right side pane of the Server Manager window, in the Roles Summary section, click **Add Roles**.

4.  If the Before You Begin page appears, click **Next**.

5.  On the Select Server Roles page, select **Windows Server Update Services**.

6.  On the Windows Server Update Services page, click **Next**.

7.  On the Confirm Installation Selections page, click **Install**.

8.  When the WSUS 3.0 SP2 Setup Wizard is started, skip the next section and see the “To continue installing WSUS 3.0 SP2” procedure.

### If You Are Using the WSUSSetup.exe File

**To start the installation of WSUS 3.0 SP2 Server or the WSUS 3.0 SP2 Administration Console by using the WSUSSetup.exe file**
1.  Log on to the server on which you plan to install WSUS 3.0 SP2 by using an account that is a member of the local Administrators group.

2.  Double-click the **WSUSSetup.exe** installer file.

3.  When the Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2 Setup Wizard is started, see the “To continue installing WSUS 3.0 SP2” procedure.

### Using the WSUS 3.0 SP2 Setup Wizard

The WSUS Setup Wizard is launched from Server Manager or from the WSUSSetup.exe file.

**To continue installing WSUS 3.0 SP2**
1.  On the Welcome page of the Windows Server Update Services 3.0 Setup Wizard, click **Next**.

2.  On the Installation Mode Selection page, select **Full server installation including Administration Console** if you want to install the WSUS server on this computer, or **Administration Console only** if you want to install the administration console only.

3.  On the License Agreement page, read the terms of the license agreement, click **I accept the terms of the License agreement**, and then click **Next**.

4.  You can specify where clients get updates on the Select Update Source page of the installation wizard. By default, the **Store updates locally** check box is selected and updates will be stored on the WSUS server in the location that you specify. If you clear the **Store updates locally** check box, client computers obtain approved updates by connecting to Microsoft Update. Make your selection, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the Database Options page, select the software that is used to manage the WSUS 3.0 SP2 database. By default, the installation wizard offers to install Windows Internal Database.

    If you do not want to use Windows Internal Database, provide an instance of SQL Server for WSUS to use by selecting **Use an existing database on this server** or **Use an existing database server on a remote computer**. Type the instance name in the applicable box. The instance name should appear as &lt;*serverName*&gt;\\&lt;*instanceName*&gt;, where *serverName* is the name of the server and *instanceName* is the name of the SQL instance. Make your selection, and then click **Next**.

6.  If you have opted to connect to a SQL Server, on the **Connecting to SQL Server Instance** page, WSUS will try to connect to the specified instance of SQL Server. When it has connected successfully, click **Next** to continue.

7.  On the Web Site Selection page, specify the Web site that WSUS will use. If you want to use the default Web site on port 80, select **Use the existing IIS Default Web site**. If you already have a Web site on port 80, you can create an alternate site on port 8530 or 8531 by selecting **Create a Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2 Web site**. Click **Next**.

8.  On the **Ready to Install Windows Server Update Services** page, review the selections, and then click **Next**.

9.  The final page of the installation wizard will let you know if the WSUS installation completed successfully. After you click **Finish** the configuration wizard will start.
