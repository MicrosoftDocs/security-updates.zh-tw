Approving Office Updates
========================

If you use WSUS to update Microsoft Office on your network computers, consider the following:

-   You must use an original baseline source for Microsoft Office Administrative Install Points (AIP) to use WSUS to update Office on client computers. If you are applying updates to the AIP, you cannot use WSUS. The two methods of applying updates are mutually exclusive. If you have applied an update to an AIP and want to roll back the AIP to an original baseline source, use the instructions found at the Microsoft Support Web site at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=63962](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=63962).

> [!Important] 
> Administrative Install Points are relevant only to OfficeÂ XP and Office 2003. They are not used with Office 2007. 

-   If you have purchased a "per user" license agreement for Office, you must ensure that each user's installation of Office is updated (for example, there might be two users who run individually licensed copies of Microsoft Office on the same computer). This means a particular user has to be logged on to the computer for that specific copy of Office to be updated. For example, if two people both have accounts on a computer that is running Microsoft Office, then each of them has to log on and update his or her Office installation, otherwise one of them will not have an updated version of Office.
-   Users can access the public Microsoft Office Online Web site and can look for updates to their Office installation through the Microsoft Office Update wizard. Using Group Policy, you might want to create policies that prevent users from getting their own Office updates from Microsoft Office Online.
