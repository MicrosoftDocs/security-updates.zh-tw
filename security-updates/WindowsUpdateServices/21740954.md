Viewing the Updates
===================

On the **Updates** page, you can do the following:

-   View updates. The update overview displays updates that have been synchronized from the update source to your WSUS server and are available for approval.
-   Filter updates. In the default view you can filter updates by approval status and installation status. The default setting is for unapproved updates that are needed by some clients or that have had installation failures on some clients. You can change this view by changing the approval status and installation status filters, and then clicking **Refresh**.
-   Create new update views. In the Actions pane, click **New Update View**. You can filter updates by classification, product, the group for which they have been approved, and synchronization date. You can sort the list by clicking the appropriate column heading in the title bar.
-   Search for updates. You can search for an individual update or set of updates by title, description, Knowledge Base article, or the Microsoft Security Response Center number for the update.
-   View details, status, and revision history for each update.
-   Approve updates.
-   Decline updates.
