Personalize the WSUS Display
============================

You can configure different aspects of the way WSUS server information is displayed in the WSUS Administration console. You can display information from downstream replica servers when you view computer and update status information. You can have validation errors displayed as pop-up windows. And you can display different types of information in the computer overview's **To Do** section.

**To display rollup data from downstream replica servers**
1.  From the WSUS Administration console, click **Options**, and then click **Personalization**.

2.  On the **General** tab, select the **Include computers and status from replica downstream servers** check box.

3.  Click **OK**.
