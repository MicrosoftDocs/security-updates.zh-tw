New in Windows Server Update Services
=====================================

WSUS is the next version of Software Update Services (SUS). It builds on the features of SUS by providing the following:

-   More updates for Microsoft products.
-   Ability to automatically download updates from Microsoft Update by product and type.
-   Additional language support for customers worldwide.
-   Maximized bandwidth efficiency through Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) 2.0. (BITS 2.0 is not installed by WSUS, and is available on Windows Update.)
-   Ability to target updates to specific computers and computer groups.
-   Ability to verify that updates are suitable for each computer before installation (this feature runs automatically for critical and security updates).
-   Flexible deployment options.
-   Reporting capabilities.
-   Flexible database options.
-   Data migration and import/export capabilities.
-   Extensibility through the application programming interface (API).
