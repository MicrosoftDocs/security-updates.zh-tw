Same-server Migration
=====================

The same-server migration procedure is a four-step process, with an optional step for testing. If you intend to utilize the SUS server to deploy WSUS, use this process. If you have multiple SUS servers in your organization, you can use this process in combination with remote server migration to consolidate multiple SUS servers on the server running WSUS.

Step 1 Same Server Migration: Install and Configure WSUS
--------------------------------------------------------

When installing WSUS on a computer that has SUS installed, you must install WSUS by using a custom port. You must synchronize the WSUS server prior to migrating. Consider using the synchronization option for deferred downloads, which is enabled by default. Also, configure WSUS to download updates for the same number of languages that SUS was configured to download updates. By default, WSUS is configured to download all languages. These configurations ensure that you do not unnecessarily download updates already on your network or in languages that you do not require.

**To install and configure WSUS on the SUS computer**
-   Install and configure WSUS on the SUS computer. See [Run WSUS Server Setup](https://technet.microsoft.com/63c82e0c-f8b0-451d-b32b-2275385920df) and [Configure Advanced Synchronization Options](https://technet.microsoft.com/75060d37-429c-4cf8-a5ee-708470794b7c) earlier in this guide for instruction.

Step 2 Same Server Migration: Migrate Content and Approvals
-----------------------------------------------------------

You do not have to migrate both content and approvals from the SUS server. You can opt to initially migrate content and then migrate approvals at another time, or any number of combinations that suit your purpose.

You do have to make sure that SUS is not synchronizing before you migrate content or approvals. Use WSUSutil.exe to migrate content and approvals from SUS to WSUS. For more information about WSUSutil.exe, see [Migration Command-line Tool](https://technet.microsoft.com/c06eceaf-a4f6-4b74-a694-75960fdf706b) earlier in this guide.

If you intend to map SUS approvals to a WSUS computer group, first create the group on WSUS. For step-by-step instruction, see [Create Computer Groups for Computers](https://technet.microsoft.com/07c6fa5b-7588-43f2-a495-45df16a2958a) earlier in this guide.

**To migrate local content and approvals from SUS and map approvals to a custom computer group on WSUS**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the directory that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content** *PathToLocalSUSContent* **/approvals** *SUSServerName* **"***WSUSTargetGroupName***" /log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content c:\\sus\\content\\cabs /approvals sus1 "all desktops" /log local\_migration.log**

    That is, WSUSutil.exe followed by the **migratesus** command, a space, the **/content** command-line option, a space, the location of the SUS .cab files, a space, the **/approvals** command-line option, a space, the NetBIOS or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the SUS server, a space, a quotation mark, the name of the target group on WSUS, another quotation mark, a space, the **/log** command-line option, a space, and the name of the log file.

**To migrate local content and approvals from SUS and map approvals to the All Computers target group on WSUS**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the directory that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content** *PathToLocalSUSContent* **/approvals** *SUSServerName* **/log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content c:\\sus\\content\\cabs /approvals sus1 /log local\_migration.log**

**To migrate only local content**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the directory that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content** *PathToLocalSUSContent ***/log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /content c:\\sus\\content\\cabs /log local\_migration.log**

**To migrate only local approvals**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the directory that contains WSUSutil.exe.

2.  Type the following:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /approvals** *SUSServerName* **/log** *filename*

    For example:

    **wsusutil.exe migratesus /approvals sus1 /log local\_migration.log**

> [!NOTE]  
> If there are additional SUS servers in your environment and you want to consolidate them on this WSUS server, finish this procedure and testing, and then see the "Step 2 Remote Server Migration: Migrate Content and Approvals" section in [Remote Server Migration](https://technet.microsoft.com/30e04407-0d2a-4e28-983e-b2a82e5fa411) for instruction on migrating approvals from a remote computer.

Step 3 Same Server Migration: Test WSUS (Optional)
--------------------------------------------------

Any computer that is going to connect to WSUS must have the WSUS client installed.

**To deploy the WSUS client for testing**
-   Deploy the WSUS clients in your environment to test WSUS (optional). See [Update Automatic Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/4de6a129-fbf1-41ef-b255-5510554713c5) earlier in this guide for instruction.

Step 4 Same Server Migration: Move WSUS to Port 80
--------------------------------------------------

Decommission the SUS server, and change the WSUS Web site from the custom port to port 80. As the SUS clients check in with the WSUS server, they will find the WSUS Web site and self-update to the Automatic Updates client compatible with WSUS. Note that you do not need to make any changes to Group Policy to get the SUS clients to self-update.

If you prefer to leave your updating solution on a port other than port 80, you can leave WSUS on the custom 8530 port and change the client policy to point to this port on your WSUS server. You still need to leave the virtual selfupdate directory on port 80 to allow client computers that are not WSUS-compatible to get updated to the WSUS-compatible client.

**To decommission SUS**
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Open** box, type **inetmgr**, and then click **OK**.

3.  In IIS, right-click the SUS Web site, and then click **Stop**.

**To switch WSUS to port 80**
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Open** box, type **inetmgr**, and then click **OK**.

3.  In IIS, right-click the WSUS Web site, and then click **Properties**.

4.  In the **WSUS Administration Properties** dialog box, change the value in **TCP port** from **8530** to **80**.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you change the port number after installing WSUS, you have to create a new shortcut on your **Start** menu with the new URL to access the WSUS console from the **Start** menu. See Help and Support for instruction on creating shortcuts.
