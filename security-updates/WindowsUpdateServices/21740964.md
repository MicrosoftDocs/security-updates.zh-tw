Using the Server Cleanup Wizard
===============================

The Server Cleanup Wizard is integrated into the user interface of WSUS 3.0, WSUS 3.0 with SP1, and WSUS with SP2e, and can be used to help you manage your disk space. This wizard can do the following things:

1.  Remove unused updates and update revisions
    The wizard will remove all older updates and update revisions that have not been approved.
2.  Delete computers not contacting the server
    The wizard will delete all client computers that have not contacted the server in thirty days or more.
3.  Delete unneeded update files
    The wizard will delete all update files that are not needed by updates or by downstream servers.
4.  Decline expired updates
    The wizard will decline all updates that have been expired by Microsoft.
5.  Decline superseded updates
    The wizard will decline all updates that meet all the following criteria:
    -   The superseded update is not mandatory
    -   The superseded update has been on the server for thirty days or more
    -   The superseded update is not currently reported as needed by any client
    -   The superseded update has not been explicitly deployed to a computer group for ninety days or more
    -   The superseding update must be approved for install to a computer group

 
> IMPORTANT  
> If you choose to remove unneeded content with the Server Cleanup Wizard, all the private update files that you have downloaded from the Catalog Site will be removed as well. You will need to re-import these files after running the Server Cleanup Wizard.

Running the Server Cleanup Wizard
---------------------------------

**To run the Server Cleanup Wizard**
1.  In the WSUS administration console, select **Options**, and then **Server Cleanup Wizard**.

2.  By default this wizard will remove unneeded content and computers that have not contacted the server for 30 days or more. Select all possible options, and then click **Next**.

3.  The wizard will begin the cleanup process, and will present a summary of its work when it is finished. Click **Finish** to complete the process.

In some cases, particularly if you run the Server Cleanup Wizard on a WSUS 3.0, WSUS 3.0 with SP1, or WSUS 3.0 with SP2 server that has WSUS 2.0 downstream servers, you may see discrepancies in update metadata on upstream and downstream servers. If this is the case, you may solve your problem by running **iisreset** on the upstream server to refresh the Web cache.
