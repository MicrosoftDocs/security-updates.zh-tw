Step 2: Install WSUS
====================

After reviewing the installation requirements, you are ready to install WSUS. You must log on to the server you plan to install WSUS on by using an account that is a member of the local Administrators group. Only members of the local Administrators group can install WSUS.

The following procedure uses the default WSUS installation options for Windows SBS 2003 with SP1. These options include using Windows SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (WMSDE) as the WSUS database software, storing updates locally, and using the Internet Information Services (IIS) custom Web site on port 8530. You can find procedures for custom installation options, such as using different database software, in “Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services” at the [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you plan to install WSUS on a server that has Windows Update Services Beta 1 or Beta 2 installed, you first need to uninstall the earlier version by using Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

**To download the WSUS installer to your server**
1.  On the computer running Windows SBS, create a folder named WSUSFiles on the local hard disk.

2.  Read how to register to download the latest version of WSUSSetup.exe at the [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=51144) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=51144).

3.  Answer all of the required questions on the Windows Server Update Services Registration Wizard Web page, and then click **Continue**.

4.  When the file download security warning appears, click **Save**.

5.  In the **Save As** dialog box, browse to the WSUSFiles folder, and then click **Save**.

**To prepare the WSUS database**
1.  Extract the WSUS Setup files.

    1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, and then type **C:\\WSUSFiles\\WSUSSetup.exe /X**, where C: is the letter of your local hard disk.
    2.  When prompted for a location to extract the files, select the WSUSFiles folder.

2.  Type the following command, where C: is the letter of your local hard disk, and then press ENTER:
    
    ```
        CD C:\WSUSFiles\wmsde 
    ```

3.  Type the following command with consideration to the points listed below, and then press ENTER:

    ```
        Sqlrun03.msi InstanceName=WSUS BlankSAPwd=1 Reboot=ReallySuppress DisableNetworkProtocols=1 DisableAgentStartup=1 DisableThrottle=1
    ```

    -   If you want to specify the drive letter where the database instance will be located, you must add the DataDir="*Path*" argument to the command line, where *Path* is the path to the target directory in the file system.
    -   The command line implies that your WSUS database will have a blank password. However, during the actual installation of WSUS, a randomly generated password is set. You do not need to specify a password.
    -   The command line is not case sensitive.

4.  Start the MSSQL$WSUS service. To do this, click **Start**, click **Run**, and then type **Services.msc**. Right-click **MSSQL$WSUS**, and then click **Start**. If the service is not listed, rerun the command in Step 3 of this procedure.

**To install WSUS**
1.  Click **Start**, click **Run**, and then type **C:\\WSUSFiles\\WSUSSetup.exe**, where C: is the letter of your local hard disk.

2.  On the **Welcome** page of the wizard, click **Next**.

3.  Review the license agreement carefully. To continue, you must accept the agreement.

4.  On the **Select Update Source** page, you can specify where the client computers get updates. If you select the **Store updates locally** check box, updates are stored on the server and you can select a location in the file system to store updates. If you do not store updates locally, the client computers connect to Microsoft Update to get approved updates.

    Keep the default option to store updates locally, either choose a location to store updates or accept the default location, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Database Options** page, keep the default options, and then click **Next**. Because you installed WMSDE in the previous procedure, changing the options on this page of the wizard has no effect.

6.  On the **Web Site Selection** page, specify a Web site for WSUS to use. This page also lists two important URLs based on this selection: the URL to which you will point WSUS client computers to get updates, and the URL for the WSUS console where you can configure WSUS.

    Keep the default option and click **Next**.

7.  On the **Mirror Update Settings** page, keep the default option and click **Next**.

    If you want to use multiple WSUS servers in a central management topology, see “Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services” at the [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171) (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=41171).

8.  On the **Ready to Install Windows Server Update Services** page, review the selections, and then click **Next**.

9.  If the final page of the wizard confirms that WSUS installation was successfully completed, click **Finish**.

> [!NOTE]
> After you install WSUS, you can delete the C:\\WSUSFiles folder. However, do not delete the C:\\WSUS folder, which is created when WSUS is installed.
