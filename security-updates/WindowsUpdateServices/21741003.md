Appendix C: Configure WSUS for Network Load Balancing
=====================================================

Network load balancing (NLB) is a strategy that can keep networks running even if one (or more) servers go offline. It can be used in conjunction with WSUS, but requires special steps at setup time.

Confirm that you have completed WSUS setup and configured your SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2008 database as a failover cluster before configuring the NLB cluster. For more information about how to set up an NLB cluster, see [Network Load Balancing Clusters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=76491) at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=76491.

 
> [!NOTE]  
> None of the servers taking part in the cluster should be a front-end domain controller.

 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The maximum number of front-end WSUS servers per database instance is four.

Step 1: Configure remote SQL
----------------------------

Confirm that you have configured WSUS for remote SQL according to the procedure in [Appendix B: Configure Remote SQL](https://technet.microsoft.com/c7054b82-8ed6-4774-9252-46c84e50ef8c) earlier in this guide.

When you have finished this step, you will have the back-end SQL machine set up, as well as one of the front-end WSUS server machines. In the next step you will set up the other front-end WSUS servers.

Step 2: Set up the other front-end WSUS servers
-----------------------------------------------

In this step you will install WSUS on the other front-end WSUS servers without creating the database.

**To install WSUS on the front-end computer**
1.  At the command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the WSUS Setup program, and type:

    **WSUSSetup.exe /q FRONTEND\_SETUP=1 SQLINSTANCE\_NAME=server\\instance CREATE\_DATABASE=0**

2.  You will see the **Welcome** page of the installation wizard. Continue installing WSUS using the procedure in [Run WSUS 3.0 SP2 Server Setup](https://technet.microsoft.com/3bc2933c-8d26-4594-b989-e64b406f3147).

 
> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using the default SQL instance, leave the instance name blank. For example, if you are using the default instance on a server named MySQLServer, SQLINSTANCE_NAME should be MySQLServer.

Step 3: Configure the front-end WSUS servers
--------------------------------------------

All the front-end WSUS servers should use a proxy server and should authenticate by means of the same user name and password. You can configure this in the WSUS administration console.

**To configure the proxy server on WSUS front-end servers**
1.  In the WSUS administration console, select **Options**, then **Update Source and Proxy Server**.

2.  Select the **Proxy Server** tab, then enter the proxy server name, port, user name, domain, and password, then click **OK**.

3.  Repeat this procedure on all the front-end WSUS servers.

Step 4: Set up a DFS share
--------------------------

You should create a single file location that is available to all the front-end WSUS servers. Even if you do not store updates locally, you will need a location for End User License Agreement files. You may choose to store them on a Distributed File System share.

 
> [!NOTE]  
> It is not necessary to use a DFS share with an NLB cluster. You can use a standard network share, and you can ensure redundancy by storing updates on a RAID controller.

This step explains how to set up DFS on one of the servers in your cluster on a Windows Server 2003 server.

**To set up a DFS share**
1.  Go to **Start**, point at **All Programs**, point at **Administrative Tools**, and click **Distributed File System**.

2.  You will see the **Distributed File System** management console. Right-click the **Distributed File System** node in the left pane and click **New Root** in the shortcut menu.

3.  You will see the **New Root Wizard**. Click **Next**.

4.  In the **Root Type** screen, select **Stand-alone root** as the type of root, and click **Next**.

5.  In the **Host Server** screen, type the name of the host server for the DFS root or search for it with **Browse**, and then click **Next**.

6.  In the **Root Name** screen, type the name of the DFS root, and then click **Next**.

7.  In the **Root Share** screen, select the folder that will serve as the share, or create a new one. Click **Next**.

8.  In the last screen of the wizard, review your selections before clicking **Finish**.

9.  You will see an error message if the Distributed File System service has not yet been started on the server. You can start it at this time.

10. Make sure that the domain account of each of the front-end WSUS servers has change permissions on the root folder of this share. That is, if there is a WSUS server installed locally on the computer that has the DFS share, the Network Service account should have change permissions on the root folder. In addition, the user account of the administrator who will run the **movecontent** command (in Step 5) should also have change permissions. For each of the remote WSUS servers, the *domain/computer* account (where domain is the name of the domain and computer is the name of the computer) should have change permissions on the root folder of the share.

    After you install a WSUS update, verify the NTFS permissions on the WSUSContent folder. The NTFS permissions on the WSUSContent folder may be reset to the default values by the installer.

 
> [!NOTE]  
> For more information about setting permissions on DFS shares, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=86550">KB 308568</a>, &quot;How To Set File Permissions for Shares in DFS Replica Sets to Apply to All Replicas&quot; (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=86550).

Step 5: Configure IIS on the front-end WSUS servers
---------------------------------------------------

In order to access the updates on the DFS share, the front-end WSUS servers must have IIS configured to allow remote access.

**To configure IIS for remote access on the front-end WSUS servers**
1.  On each of the servers, go to **Start**, point at **All Programs**, point at **Administrative Tools**, and click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.

2.  You will see the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** management console.

3.  Click the server node, then the **Web Sites** node, then the node for the WSUS Web site (either **Default Web Site** or **WSUS Administration**).

4.  Right-click the **Content** node and select **Properties**.

5.  In the **Content Properties** dialog box, click the **Virtual Directory** tab. In the top frame you will see **The content for this resource should come from:**

6.  Select **A share located on another computer** and fill in the UNC name of the share.

7.  Click **Connect As**, and enter the user name and password that can be used to access that share.

8.  Be sure to follow these steps for each of the front-end WSUS servers that are not on the same machine as the DFS share.

Step 6: Move the local content directory on the first front-end WSUS server to the DFS share
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it is possible to move the content directories on the first front-end WSUS server to the DFS share. This is the first WSUS front-end server you set up in Step 1. You will not have to move the local content directory on the front-end servers you set up in Step 2.

**To move the content directories on the front-end WSUS servers**
1.  Open a command window.

2.  Go to the WSUS tools directory on the WSUS server:

    **cd \\Program Files\\Update Services\\Tools**

3.  Type the following command:

    **wsusutil movecontent ***DFSsharename logfilename*

    where *DFSsharename* is the name of the DFS share to which the content should be moved, and *logfilename* is the name of the log file.

Step 7: Configure the NLB
-------------------------

Refer to [Network Load Balancing Clusters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=76491) at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=76491 for more information about this topic.

**To configure Network Load Balancing**
1.  Enable Network Load Balancing:

    -   Click **Start**, then **Control Panel**, **Network Connections**, **Local Area Connection**, and click **Properties**.
    -   Under **This connection uses the following items**, you may see an entry for Network Load Balancing. If you do not, click **Install**, then (on the **Select Network Component Type** screen) select **Service**, then click **Add**, then (on the **Select Network Service** screen) select **Network Load Balancing**, then **OK**.
    -   On the **Local Area Connection Properties** screen, select **Network Load Balancing**, and then click **OK**.

2.  On the **Local Area Connection Properties** screen, select **Network Load Balancing**, and then click **Properties.**

3.  On the **Cluster Parameters** tab, fill in the relevant information (the virtual IP address to be shared among the front end computers, and the subnet mask). Under **Cluster operation mode**, select **Unicast**.

4.  On the **Host Parameters** tab, make sure that the unique host identifier is different for each member of the cluster.

5.  On the **Port Rules** tab, make sure that there is a port rule specifying single affinity (the default). (Affinity is the term used to define how client requests are to be directed. Single affinity means that requests from the same client will always be directed to the same cluster host.)

6.  Click **OK**, and return to the **Local Area Connection Properties** screen.

7.  Select **Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)** and click **Properties**, and then click **Advanced**.

8.  On the **IP Settings** tab, under **IP addresses**, add the virtual IP of the cluster (so that there will be two IP addresses). This should be done on each cluster member.

9.  On the **DNS** tab, clear the **Register this connection's addresses in DNS** checkbox. Make sure that there is no DNS entry for the IP address.

Step 8: Test the WSUS NLB configuration
---------------------------------------

You should first make sure that at least one of the WSUS front-end servers can perform an initial synchronization. If the synchronization is successful, continue to the next step. Otherwise, review the WSUS setup and NLB cluster setup.

Step 9: Configure WSUS clients to sync from the DFS share
---------------------------------------------------------

Instructions for configuring WSUS client machines are given in [Update and Configure the Automatic Updates Client](https://technet.microsoft.com/d3d56210-9f71-49b7-b0d1-a04fb52d4e53). However, in the case of WSUS on NLB clusters, you should specify the virtual address of the NLB cluster rather than one of the individual servers. For example, if you are setting up your clients with a Group Policy object or Local Group Policy object, the setting for the **Specify intranet Microsoft update service location** setting should be the virtual Web address.

 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you are using a DFS share, be careful when uninstalling WSUS from one but not all of the front-end servers. If you allow the WSUS content directory to be deleted, this will affect all the WSUS front-end servers.

Upgrading NLB
-------------

 
> [!NOTE]  
> Check to see if you have followed all the steps mentioned above to configure WSUS for NLB.If the steps have not been followed then reconfigure the WSUS for NLB following all the above mentioned steps.

**To upgrade NLB on all machines**
1.  Shut down the NLB service. At the command prompt type **nlb.exe suspend.**

2.  Shut down IIS and the WSUS service. At the command prompt type **iisreset/stop** and then **net stop wsusservice.**

3.  Ensure no other services are able to access the database during the upgrade window. At the command prompt type **nlb.exe disable.**

4.  Back up your database.

    1.  On your machine hosting the database, click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
    2.  In the **Open** box, type *%systemdrive%*\\*%windir%*\\**system32**\\**ntbackup.exe** and then click **OK**.
    3.  In the Backup or Restore Wizard, click **Next**.
    4.  Verify that **Backup files and settings** is selected, and then click **Next**.
    5.  Click **Let me choose what to back up**, and then click **Next**.
    6.  Under the location where your database files are stored, click the **Data** and **LOG** folders, and then click **Next**.
    7.  Use the **Browse** button to choose a place to save your backup, type a name for the backup, and then click **Next**.
    8.  If you want to set additional specifications for your backup, including whether it will be an incremental backup and whether you want to verify the backup, set a recurring schedule for the backup, or other options, click **Advanced**, and then follow the prompts that appear in the wizard.
    9.  When the wizard is finished, click **Finish**.
    10. When the message appears that informs you that the backup is complete, click **Close**.

5.  Upgrade each frontend machine individually.

    1.  Set up WSUS. At the command prompt type **Wsussetup.exe/q/g.**
    2.  Review the setup log to verify the upgrade was successful. At the command prompt type **Wsussetup.log**
    3.  Ensure that IIS and the WSUS service are stopped. At the command prompt type **iisreset/stop** and then **net stop wsusservice.**
    4.  Proceed to the next machine.

6.  Start IIS and the WSUS service. Click the **Start** button, point to **Administrative tools**, click **Services**, and then click the service you want to start.

7.  Start the NLB service. At the command prompt, type **nlb.exe resume.**
