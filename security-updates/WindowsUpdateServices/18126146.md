Step 2: Copying Updates from the File System
============================================

Copy updates from the file system of the exporting server to the file system of the importing server. The procedures described below use the Windows Backup or Restore Wizard, but you can use any utility you like, including xcopy. The object is to copy updates from the file system on the exporting server to the files system of the importing server. When you copy files to the importing server, you must maintain the folder structure for all folders under the content directory. Make sure that the updates appear in the folder on the importing server that has been designated to store updates; this designation is typically made during the setup process. You should also consider using an incremental backup system to limit the amount of data you need to move each time you refresh the server on the disconnected network.

**To back up updates from file system of the exporting server to a file**
1.  On your exporting WSUS server, click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **ntbackup**. The **Backup or Restore Wizard** starts by default, unless it is disabled. You can use this wizard or click the link to work in **Advanced Mode** and use the following steps.

3.  Click the **Backup** tab, and then select the folder where updates are stored on the exporting server. By default, WSUS stores updates at *WSUSInstallationDrive*\\WSUS\\WSUSContent\\, where *WSUSInstallationDrive* is the drive on which WSUS is installed.

4.  In the **Backup media or file name** box, type a path and file name for the backup (.bkf) file.

5.  Click **Start Backup**. The **Backup Job Information** dialog box appears.

6.  Click **Advanced**. Under **Backup Type**, click **Incremental**.

7.  From the **Backup Job Information** dialog box, click **Start Backup** to start the backup operation.

8.  Copy the backup file you just created to the importing server.

**To restore updates from a file to the file system of the importing server**
1.  On your importing WSUS server, click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  In the **Run** dialog box, type **ntbackup**. The **Backup or Restore Wizard** starts by default, unless it is disabled. You can use this wizard or click the link to work in **Advanced Mode** and use the following steps.

3.  Click the **Restore and Manage Media** tab, and select the backup file you created on the exporting server. If the file does not appear, right-click **File**, and then click **Catalog File** to add the location of the file.

4.  In the **Restore files to** box, click **Alternate location**. This option preserves the folder structure of the updates; all folders and subfolders will appear in the folder you designate. You must maintain the directory structure for all folders under \\WSUSContent.

5.  Under **Alternate location**, specify the folder where updates are stored on the importing server. By default, WSUS stores updates at *WSUSInstallationDrive*\\WSUS\\WSUSContent\\, where *WSUSInstallationDrive* is the drive on which WSUS is installed. Updates must appear in the folder on the importing server designated to hold updates; this is typically done during installation.

6.  Click **Start Restore**. When the **Confirm Restore** dialog box appears, click **OK** to start the restore operation.
