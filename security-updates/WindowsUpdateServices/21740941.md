Approve WSUS 3.0 SP2 Updates
============================

You should approve updates to test the functionality of your WSUS deployment. There are many options for deploying updates; the procedure below covers only the basics. Refer to the Microsoft Windows Update Services 3.0 SP2 Operations Guide to understand all of your approval options, including Automatic Approval rules.

**To approve multiple updates for installation**
1.  On the WSUS Administration console, click **Updates**, and then click **All Updates** or the classification of updates you want to approve.

2.  On the list of updates, right-click the update or updates you want to approve for installation, and then click **Approve** on the shortcuts menu.

3.  In the **Approve Updates** dialog box, click the arrow next to the computer group for which you want to approve the updates, and then click **Approved for Install**.

4.  If you want to approve these updates for subgroups of this group, click the arrow again, and then click **Apply to Children**.

5.  If you want to specify a deadline (that is, a time by which these updates should be installed), click the arrow again, and then click **Deadline**. You may specify a standard time (one week, one month, etc.) or a custom time.

6.  Do the same for any other groups for which you would like to approve the selected updates.

7.  When you have finished setting up the approvals, click **Approve**.

8.  You will see the **Approval Progress** window while the updates are being approved. If there is any problem, such as a conflict among the selected updates, it will be reported here. You may click **Cancel** to exit the approval process at any time. When the approval process completes successfully, close the window.

 
> NOTE  
> If you want to install an update immediately, you can specify a deadline at the current time or in the past. You can find more information about how clients install updates with deadlines in <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/f4aff13a-07f0-4939-881f-95191a025fcc">Client Behavior with Update Deadlines</a>
