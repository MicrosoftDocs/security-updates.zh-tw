Issues with Upgrades
====================

Use the information below to troubleshoot WSUS upgrade issues.

Troubleshooting WSUS Upgrades
-----------------------------

#### If a WSUS Upgrade Fails, WSUS May Be Uninstalled

You may lose your previous WSUS settings and data if an upgrade fails. Therefore, before attempting an upgrade, back up the following:

-   WSUS database
-   Update file storage folder

For information about backing up and restoring your existing WSUS installation, see [Backing Up Windows Server Update Services 3.0 SP2](https://technet.microsoft.com/df778948-c8eb-4b09-8db3-94a496340713).

#### Upgrading to WSUS 3.0 from WSUS 2 0

When upgrading to WSUS 3.0 from WSUS 2.0, the configuration points to the port 8530. This causes a mismatch in the WSUS environment because other machines are configured to point to the original port (80) of this WSUS server. In this case, the WSUS 3.0 port should be switched back to 80 by using the following syntax.

**WSUSUtil.exe useCustomWebsite false**

#### Certificate Not Configured after WSUS 2.0 SP2 is Upgraded to WSUS 3.0 with Custom Web site

If WSUS 2.0 SP2 was configured to use SSL, you will need to reinstall the certificate after the upgrade is complete by using the following syntax:

**wsusutil configuressl**Â *ServerCertificateName*
