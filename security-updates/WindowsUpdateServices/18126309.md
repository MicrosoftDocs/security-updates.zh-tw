Step-by-Step Guide to Migrating from Software Update Services to Windows Server Update Services 2.0
===================================================================================================

This guide offers instruction for installing Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) on a computer with Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS) running either Microsoft Windows Server 2003 operating systems (except for Web Edition and all 64-bit versions) or Windows® 2000 Server. If you want to install WSUS on a computer that does not have SUS installed and then migrate SUS approvals and updates, see the “Deploying Microsoft Windows Server Update Services” white paper.

Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is the next iteration of Software Update Services (SUS). Although you cannot upgrade a SUS server to a WSUS server, there is support for migrating your approvals and updates from SUS to the new WSUS server. This ensures that you do not have to download the same updates twice, nor spend time approving previously approved updates. If you are using multiple SUS servers to target updates to computers fulfilling specific roles on the network, you can map SUS approvals to WSUS computer groups as you migrate the approvals. This allows you to consolidate multiple SUS servers on a single WSUS server.

It is simple to introduce WSUS into your production environment. You can install WSUS and SUS on the same computer and both will function. You can also have SUS and WSUS environments running simultaneously on your network. However, you can never synchronize a SUS server with a WSUS server or vice versa. Beyond the migration, the two update solutions are completely isolated from one another. This enables you to test WSUS in your production environment while relying on SUS to update client computers. When WSUS testing is complete and you are comfortable with the new solution, you can decommission SUS.
